     <p class="para"><b>Muhammad ﷺ </b>born in 570 CE, was the last prophet of Islam. He received the <br>first revelation at the age of 40 and preached monotheism, calling people to abandon idol <br>worship. Despite facing persecution, <b>Muhammad ﷺ </b>and his followers migrated to Medina in 622 <br>CE. There, he established an Islamic state and led military expeditions. In 630 CE, he <br>peacefully conquered Mecca and forgave his enemies. Muhammad ﷺ's teachings, recorded in the <br><SPAN>QURAN </SPAN>and Hadith, promote social justice, women's rights, and religious <br>tolerance. His life and teachings continue to inspire millions of Muslims worldwide.</p>
